\section{Introduction}
\noindent The paper we investigate deals with the problem of motivating an agent in a high-dimensional state space to explore the environment more exhaustively during training and thereby find non-obvious trajectories that can lead to higher long-term rewards for both discrete and continuous action spaces. The paper compares the new \textit{Random Latent Exploration} (RLE) technique to standard \textit{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO, see \cite{ppo-paper}), \textit{NoisyNet} (see \cite{noisynet-paper}) and \textit{Random Network Distillation} (RND, see \cite{rnd-paper}).

\noindent Exploration is one of the major issues of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its techniques can generally be divided into two categories: Noise-based exploration and bonus-based exploration. There are advantages and disadvantages for both of them but we always have to keep in mind that always choosing the highest short-term (local) reward does not necessarily also yield the highest long-term (global) reward, e.g. picture the environment as shown in figure \ref{fig:sample-env-1}. Here, the agent starting in the \textcolor{blue}{blue state} will always choose the small reward of $1$, i.e. going right, then move back to the initial state, then move right, and so on, dithering between these two states, instead of accepting to collect a reward of $0$ by going left in order to be able to collect the much higher reward of $100$ in the following step.

\noindent \cite{rle-paper} use RND to represent bonus-based exploration, NoisyNet to represent noise-based exploration and standard PPO as the baseline benchmark.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Random Latent Exploration}

\noindent The new idea that the authors \cite{rle-paper} present is to augment the reward function by adding a randomized term which incentivizes the agent to explore a larger portion of the state space. In particular, we will call this term $F(s, z)$ or intrinsic reward function, where $s \in \mathcal{S}$ is any state of the state space $\mathcal{S}$, and $\textbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector sampled from a given distribution $P_{\textbf{z}}$. The authors \cite{rle-paper} claim that RLE's efficiency is not significantly affected by the choice of $P_{\textbf{z}}$. If at time step $t \in \{0, 1, 2, ..., T\}$ the agent in state $s_{t}$ takes action $a_{t} \sim \pi(. | s_{t})$ from policy $\pi$, then it will obtain the task reward $r (s_{t}, a_{t})$. In RLE, we train a so-called latent-conditioned policy network $\pi(. | s, \textbf{z})$ and latent-conditioned value network $V^{\pi}(s, \textbf{z})$ to estimate and then maximize the expected sum of rewards from a given state, aware of the random term $z$:

\begin{equation}
    V^{\pi}(s, \textbf{z}) \approx \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[\sum_{t = 0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t} \left(r(s_{t}, a_{t}) + F(s_{t+1}, \textbf{z})\right) \right]
    \label{eq:value_func}
\end{equation}

\noindent In \eqref{eq:value_func}, $\gamma$ describes the discount factor and $F(s_{t+1}, \textbf{z}) =  \boldsymbol{\phi}(s) \cdot \textbf{z}$ where $\boldsymbol{\phi}(s): \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a feature extraction network. The feature network is updated as a linear combination of the old feature network's weights and the weights of the value network\footnote{In the pseudocode algorithm in line 19 on page 25, in the mathematical formulation, the authors state that the feature network is updated as a linear combination of the old feature network's weights and the policy network's weights. We contacted the authors, and they confirmed that it should read $\phi \leftarrow \tau \cdot V^\phi + (1 - \tau ) \cdot \phi$ (i.e., the value network should be used, not the policy network). However, they state it would be interesting to explore which network should be used to update the feature network.}. Both $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and $\textbf{z}$ are $d$-dimensional vectors. Note that although equation \ref{eq:value_func} is presented by \cite{rle-paper}, in the implementation they introduce an intrinsic and extrinsic reward coefficient. In the experiments they choose intrinsic reward coefficient $\ll$ extrinsic reward coefficient. Thus, they are not directly optimizing equation \ref{eq:value_func} in the experiments. Furthermore, on page 3 the authors state that $\vz$ "is resampled at the start of each trajectory". However, in the pseudocode on page 15 the authors note that $\vz$ is resampled at the end of each trajectory or after a certain number of steps has passed. Since the authors implemented the latter, more general, case we adopt the latter approach for our experiments. The authors split the critic's head into two: one head predicts the intrinsic value function, the other head predicts the extrinsic value function. Figure \ref{fig:rle-architecture} depicts how the action logits, intrinsic value, and extrinsic value for a given observation and $\vz$ is calculated. Note the residual connection from the first element-wise addition to the second element-wise addition. There is no mention of this residual connection in the paper. However, it is present in the provided code for the \textsc{Atari} environment. To continue the example from above, in figure \ref{fig:sample-env-2} the agent would prioritize to go left as this promises the greater reward. It is not hard to imagine that for higher dimensional environments, every time we start a new trajectory and correspondingly sample a new $z$, the agent will explore a different region of the state space and thus we can discover non-obvious paths to maximize the rewards. For the detailed pseudocode of this algorithm, see \hyperlink{algo-rle}{Appendix A} \textcolor{red}{(check link before submmission)}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Proximal Policy Optimization}

\noindent The algorithm constituting the foundation of RLE is Proximal Policy Iteration (PPO), described in \cite{ppo-paper}, which can itself be run to solve RL problems. It is an on-line policy gradient method where after running the policy $\boldsymbol{\pi}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$ in parallel with $N$ actors for $T << E$ timesteps, where $E$ is the length of an episode, we compute the advantage estimator as proposed by \cite{generalized-advantage-estimation-paper} for each time index $t \in [0, T]$:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}_{t} = \delta_{t} + \left(\gamma \lambda\right) \delta_{t+1} + ... + \left(\gamma \lambda\right)^{T-t+1} \delta_{T - 1}
  \label{eq:ppo-advantage-estimator}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have $\delta_{t} = r_{t} + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_{t})$. Here, $\lambda$ is the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) parameter and $V(s)$ is a learned state-value function. Afterwards, for each $t$ the surrogate objective is computed and the parameters $\theta$ are optimized e.g. with minibatch SGD or Adam (note that we optimize by maximizing the objective). This surrogate objective takes the form:

\begin{equation}
  L_{t}^{\text{CLIP} + \text{VF} + \text{S}}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_{t} \left[L_{t}^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) - c_{1} L_{t}^{\text{VF}}(\theta) + c_{2} S[\boldsymbol{\pi}_{\theta}](s_{t})\right]
  \label{eq:ppo-objective-function}
\end{equation}

\noindent In \eqref{eq:ppo-objective-function}, we have the VF coefficient $c_{1}$ and the entropy coefficient $c_{2}$, together with the (optional, to enhance exploration) entropy bonus $S[\boldsymbol{\pi}_{\theta}](s_{t})$, which is calculated as the sum of $- p \log{p}$ over each of the action-probabilities $p$ resulting from the policy distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}_{\theta}$ for a state $s_{t}$, and the objectives:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ppo-clip-objective} L_{t}^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) &= \hat{\mathbb{E}}_{t}\left[\min\left(r_{t}(\theta) \hat{A}_{t}, \text{clip}\left(r_{t}(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon\right) \hat{A}_{t}\right)\right]\\
  \label{eq:ppo-vf-objective} L_{t}^{\text{VF}}(\theta) &= \left(V_{\theta}(s_{t}) - V_{t}^{\text{targ}}\right)^{2}
\end{align}

\noindent In \eqref{eq:ppo-clip-objective} we denote the probability ratio as $r_{t}(\theta) = \frac{\pi_{\theta}\left(a_{t}|s_{t}\right)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_{t}|s_{t})}$, where $\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}$ is the policy before the update, and the clipping function is:

\begin{equation}
  \text{clip}\left(r_{t}(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon\right) = \begin{cases}
    1 - \epsilon, &r_{t}(\theta) < 1 - \epsilon\\
    r_{t}(\theta), &1 - \epsilon \leq r_{t}(\theta) \leq 1 + \epsilon\\
    1 + \epsilon, &r_{t}(\theta) > 1 + \epsilon
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:clipping-function}
\end{equation}

\noindent Moreover in \eqref{eq:ppo-vf-objective}, $V_{t}^{\text{targ}}$ represents some target state-value function that is to be obtained. Note that there exist also other objective functions mentioned in \cite{ppo-paper} that can substitute $L_{t}^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta)$ in \eqref{eq:ppo-objective-function}. In \eqref{eq:clipping-function}, we make use of a hyperparameter $\epsilon \in [0, 1]$ and in combination with the minimizer from \eqref{eq:ppo-clip-objective} we can prevent a single policy update to accidentally ruin the policy forever by sending the algorithm to a gradient region with a worse local extremum. The detailed pseudocode of this algorithm can be found in \hyperlink{algo-ppo}{Appendix B} \textcolor{red}{(check link before submmission)}.

\noindent In the paper that we investigate, the authors \cite{rle-paper} compare the empirical results of the RLE to PPO as the baseline, as well as two other exploration techniques, namely NoisyNet and RND, which will be briefly explained in the following sections.

\subsection{NoisyNet}

\noindent The central idea in a NoisyNet architecture brought forward by \cite{noisynet-paper} is to introduce random noise into the weights learned by the network ($p$ inputs, $q$ outputs), i.e. if we have a neural network whose output can be parametrized by a vector of weights $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as $\textbf{y} = f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\textbf{x}) = \textbf{w} \cdot \textbf{x} + \textbf{b}$, then we can learn the set of parameter vectors $\zeta = (\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ to compute $\textbf{w} = (\boldsymbol{\mu}^{w} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{w} \odot \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{w}$ and $\textbf{b} = (\boldsymbol{\mu}^{b} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{b} \odot \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{b})$ with the following dimensionalities: $\boldsymbol{\mu}^{w}$, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{w}$, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times p}$ implying $\textbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times p}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}^{b}$, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{b}$, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$ resulting in $\textbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$. Note that $\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, $\textbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$ and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

\noindent We optimize the loss $\bar{L}(\zeta) = \mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon}[L(\boldsymbol{\theta})]$, i.e. the expectation of the loss $L(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ over the noise $\varepsilon$ which has a mean of zero and fixed statistics, using gradient descent on the parameters $\zeta$. The noise can be sampled either independently or in a factorized way from a Gaussian. The former method samples the noise $\varepsilon^{w}_{i,j} \in \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{w}$ and $\varepsilon^{b}_{j} \in \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{b}$ for every input to the network leading to a total of $pq + q$ random samples. Factorized sampling on the other hand greatly reduces computational complexity by factorizing $\varepsilon^{w}_{i,j} = f(\varepsilon_{i}) f(\varepsilon_{j})$ and then $\varepsilon^{b}_{j} = f(\varepsilon_{j})$ thereby lowering the number of required random samples to $p + q$, where $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. In \cite{noisynet-paper} the function $f(x) = \sign(x) \sqrt{|x|}$ is used. After sampling the noise, in theory we compute the gradients $\nabla\bar{L}(\zeta) = \nabla\mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon}[L(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon}[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}}L(\boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\varepsilon})]$, whereas in practice we approximate $\nabla\bar{L}(\zeta) \approx \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}}L(\boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \odot \boldsymbol{\varepsilon})$ with the Monte Carlo method.

\noindent In the code of \cite{rle-paper}, a NoisyNet is used in conjunction with the A3C-algorithm, in particular the loss is computed from the action-value function is estimated using:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{Q}_{i} = \sum_{j=i}^{k-1} \gamma^{j-i} r_{t+j} + \gamma^{k-i} V(x_{t+k} | \zeta, \varepsilon_{i})
\end{equation}

Moreover, for factorized networks, we initialize $\mu_{i,j} \sim \mathcal{U}\left[-\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}, +\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}\right]$ and $\sigma_{i,j} = \frac{\sigma_{0}}{\sqrt{p}}$ with $p$ being the number of inputs to the corresponding linear layer, $\mathcal{U}$ is a uniform distribution over the specified interval, and $\sigma_{0}$ is a hyperparameter. The pseudocode for this variant given by \cite{noisynet-paper} can be found in appendix \hyperlink{algo-noisynet}{Appendix C} \textcolor{red}{Check link before submission}.

\textcolor{red}{Are we using independent or factorized sampling in the code? (I'm guessing factorized).}

\subsection{Random Network Distillation}

In Random Network Distillation, as described by \cite{rnd-paper}, we compose the reward which the agent obtains as $r_{t} = e_{t} + i_{t}$ where $e_{t}$ represents a sparse extrinsic (environment's) reward and $i_{t}$ is the intrinsic reward for transitioning, i.e. the exploration bonus emanating from the transition at time step $t$. The latter measures the novelty of a state and should yield a higher value, the less frequently a state has been visited so far. In case of a finite state space we can use $i_{t} = \frac{1}{n_{t}}$ or $i_{t} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}$ where $n_{t}(s)$ denotes the number of times state $s$ has been visited until time step $t$. However, there exist alternatives, e.g. we could use state density based approaches to calculate an exploration bonus, which are described in the paper mentioned above. Moreover, they specify that in the paper the intrinsic reward is the prediction error of a randomly generated problem $i_{t} = \|\hat{f}(x|\theta) - f(x)\|^{2}$ involving a target network $f: \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{k}$ (fixed and randomly initialized, maps an observation $\mathcal{O}$ to an embedding $\mathbb{R}^{k}$) to sample the problem as well as a predictor network $\hat{f}: \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{k}$ which was trained on the agent's data by gradient descent to optimize $i_{t}$ w.r.t. parameters $\theta_{\hat{f}}$.

\noindent Since the overall return can be composed as a sum of returns $R = R_{E} + R_{I}$ we can train two heads $V_{E}$ and $V_{I}$ to estimate the value function $V = V_{E} + V_{I}$ and in extension the advantages. In the end, a policy is trained with standard PPO using the advantage estimators. Note that the intrinsic rewards have to be normalized in order to be useful because otherwise we could not guarantee that they are on a consistent scale, which is done by dividing $i_{t}$ by a running estimate of the standard deviations of the intrinsic return. Furthermore, the observation also has to be normalized as $x \leftarrow \text{clip}(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}, -5, 5)$. The normalization parameters can be initialized by letting a random agent briefly move in the environment before beginning the optimization. The pseudocode given by \cite{rnd-paper} can be found in appendix \hyperlink{algo-rnd}{Appendix D} \textcolor{red}{Check link before submission}.

\section{Scope of reproducibility}
\label{sec:claims}

\noindent The main quantifiable claims made by \cite{rle-paper} consist of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the abstract, \cite{rle-paper} claim "[...] RLE exhibits higher overall scores across all of the tasks than other approaches, including action-noise and randomized value exploration." They refer to the tasks being the \textsc{Atari}, \textsc{IssacGym} and \textsc{FourRoom} environments. The benchmark approaches are standard PPO, NoisyNet and RND.
    \item The first claim holds for "[...] both discrete and continuous control tasks." \citep{rle-paper}
    \item Moreover, "[...] introducting randomness to rewards influences the policy to produce diverse behaviors" \citep{rle-paper} which manifests itself in an incentive to explore random (and thus in aggregate lager) parts of the state space.
    \item For the discrete-action discrete-states \textsc{FourRoom} environment absent of a goal reward, the authors claim that PPO's state visitation centers around the initial room (top right) concluding that action-noise methods cannot conduct deep exploration whereas RLE, NoisyNet and RND well reach across the four rooms and thus perform deep exploration.
    \item For the more challenging discrete-action continuous-states\footnote{While the input to the action sampler is a discrete $84\times84\times4$ tensor representing the pixels it perceives, in practice \textsc{Atari} games are considered to be continuous-state environments due to the high-dimensional state space and visual complexity of each frame.} \textsc{Atari} environment, the authors claim that, in the majority of games, RLE achieves a higher IQM of the human-normalized score with a probability of $67\%$, $72\%$ and $71\%$, compared to PPO, NoisyNet and RND, respectively.\footnote{The authors mention that for the \textsc{Montezuma's Revenge} game RLE underperforms likely due to RLE not factoring in bonus-based exploration.}
    \item In the continuous-action continuous-states \textsc{IsaacGym} environment\footnote{Please note that the \textsc{IsaacGym} environment is deprecated and we're using \textsc{Isaac Lab} \textcolor{red}{(check this)} instead, however we will refer to it as \textsc{IsaacGym} for continuity.}, the authors claim that, with a probability of around $83\%$ for PPO, ca. $66\%$ for NoisyNet and roughly $65\%$ for RND, RLE improves performance in all of their selected \textsc{IsaacGym} tasks.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Our findings regarding these claims will be presented in \hyperlink{sec4}{section 4} \textcolor{red}{Check link before submission}. Moreover, \cite{rle-paper} performed ablation studies and claim to have found:

\begin{itemize}
  \item RLE performance improves over PPO irrespective of the distribution used to sample the 8-dim random latent vector.
  \item RLE performance does not significantly improve over PPO as a dependence of the dimensionality of the random latent vector.
  \item RLE performance deteriorates if the policy and value networks are not conditioned on the random latent vector.
  \item RLE performance improves slightly if we use a slow-moving estimate of the value network's learned CNN features (i.e. we update the feature network) vs. no-update.
  \item RLE performance is insensitive to the feature extractor architecture.
  \item RLE performance deteriorates if the random reward function is simply white noise (N(0,1)) and thus uncorrelated to the states.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Unfortunately due to time constraints we are not able to test all of these claims, instead we will focus on the main ones. Finally, the authors also conclude that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Contrary to Posterior Sampling where the sampling distribution eventually converges to the true model, $P_{z}$ remains fixed in RLE the random rewards will act as regularization in the later stage of training.
  \item RLE benefits from parallelization as z is independent from every other round and can be trained on identical copies of the environment thus reducing the overall running time of the training.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
Since the authors did not provide any code for the \textsc{FourRoom} environment, this environment was implemented by us using the gymnasium library introduced by \cite{gymnasium-paper}. A wrapper to record the state visitation counts per environment was also implemented. Furthermore, the code for PPO, Noisy Net, and RLE was adopted from the respective algorithms for the \textsc{Atari} environment. We also adopted the RND code for the \textsc{IsaacGym} environment to the \textsc{FourRoom} environment. Before we adopted RLE from the existing implementation for the \textsc{Atari} environment, we implemented it based on the description in \cite{rle-paper}. However, the paper lacked a lot of details present in the \textsc{Atari} code (e.g., split critic's head, residual connection) so that we decided to proceed with the adopted code to have consistent results over the different environments.

\texttt{Explain your approach - did you use the author's code, or did you aim to re-implement the approach from the description in the paper? Summarize the resources (code, documentation, GPUs) that you used.}

\noindent Since we are dealing with a reinforcement learning task, we did not use any dataset to train our models but rather four different environments which will explain in \hyperlink{experimental-setup}{section 3.4} \textcolor{red}{(check link before submission)}.

\subsection{Hyperparameters}
For the \textsc{FourRoom} experiments the hyperparameters stated in \cite{rle-paper} were used. However, \cite{rle-paper} did not provide values for all available hyperparameters. For the missing hyperparameters we used the following values, that seemed reasonable to us:

\begin{table}[ht]

  \begin{tabular}{{ll}}

\end{table}

Include the number of total experiments (e.g. hyperparameter trials). You can also include all results from that search (not just the best-found results).}

\noindent The code for our implementations can be found in GitHub\footnote{\href{https://github.com/jonupp/adv_topics_ml_repl_chal}{https://github.com/jonupp/adv\_topics\_ml\_repl\_chal} \textcolor{red}{Change github}}. There are three types of environments in use on which we run our RL algorithms which are depicted in figure \ref{fig:environmnents}.

\noindent \textcolor{red}{Do we need to explain the environments as well?}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:sample-env-fourroom} shows the \textsc{FourRoom} environment where we have $50\times50 + 4$ states\footnote{In \cite{rle-paper}, the authors claim that there are $50\times 50$ states. We contacted the authors and they confirmed that it should read $50\times 50 + 4$ states.} which are divided into four rooms of size $25\times25$ and $4$ holes in the walls located at positions $10$ horizontally and $5$ vertically, starting the count at $1$ from the inner corners. Exploring the state space, beginning from the initial state marked in \textcolor{red}{red}, becomes a deep exploration task due to the holes being only $1$ "pixel" wide. However, if we want to incentivize the agent to find a reward, then we can put it at the goal position marked in \textcolor{green}{green}. At every step, the agent can move one step vertically or horizontally, but if it would run into a wall it chooses to remain in place. \cite{rle-paper} refer to \cite{grid-world-paper} when introducing the \textsc{FourRoom} environment. \cite{grid-world-paper} use action stochasticity. We asked \cite{rle-paper} whether they also used action stochasticity, and they stated that they did not use action stochasticity in their experiments. \cite{rle-paper} claims that RLE shows good exploration behavior based on a single heatmap of state visitation counts. To assess whether this result is expected or exceptional we trained each algorithm 20 times. Since it is not reasonable to compare 20 state visitation count heatmaps we used the Shannon entropy, introduced by \cite{shannon-entropy-paper}, of the state visitation counts as a proxy for how well an agent explored the environment. With increasing entropy the distribution of the state visitation counts becomes more uniform. Thus, the higher the entropy the better the explorative behavior. Furthermore, it was explored if the intrinsic value function really guides the generation of diverse trajectories. To assess this, the intrinsic value function for four latent vectors $z$ and four trajectories generated using the same latent vector $z$ were saved at the end of each experiment. We also tested to what degree RLE is indifferent to the distribution of the latent vector. To test this, we ran RLE with different latent vector distributions. The following distributions were considered: standard normal distribution, standard uniform distribution, Von-Mises distribution with $\mu=0$ and $\kappa=0.3$, and the exponential distribution with $\lambda=0.3$. We ran 20 experiments for each latent vector distribution and recorded the state visitation entropy. The same hyperparameters were used as before. Note that all latent vectors were normalized using the L2-norm, so that all latent vectors are on a unit sphere around the origin. This ensures that all intrinsic rewards are in the interval [-1,1]. \cite{rle-paper} performed a similar ablation study for the \textsc{Atari} environment. However, they did not normalize the latent vectors for all distributions. They only applied normalization for the normal distribution which they then denoted as "Sphere", that they compare to the unnormalized uniform distribution and the unnormalized normal distribution. We normalized all distributions because the "extrinsic reward coefficient" and the "intrinsic reward coefficient" hyperparameters already control the weighting between the intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, so we wanted the intrinsic rewards to be in the interval [-1,1].

\noindent Moreover we have an example of the \textsc{Atari} environments in figure \ref{fig:sample-env-atari}, namely the \textsc{Alien-v5} game. In this environment, the agent perceives the $4$ most recent $84\times84$ grayscale frames. In the \textsc{IsaacGym} environment on the other hand, \textcolor{red}{<finish the environment description later>}.

\texttt{Include a description of how the experiments were set up that's clear enough a reader could replicate the setup.}
\texttt{Include a description of the specific measure used to evaluate the experiments (e.g. accuracy, precision@K, BLEU score, etc.).}
\texttt{Provide a link to your code or notebook (if available). Add in this section (or in the following) any reference to cloud-based providers you}

\subsection{Computational requirements}

\noindent The code for the \textsc{FourRoom} experiments was exclusively run on the CPU. For Atari, we experimented with the CPU, T4 GPU and TPU v2-8 in Google Colab. Weights \& Biases (wandb) was used for easier runtime visualization of the scores and other measures.

\noindent We would like to note, however, that \cite{rle-paper} had available the HPC resources of the MIT Supercloud and the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center. Within the framework of this course, we did not have the equivalent computing power to replicate all experiments in their original form and had to restrain ourselves to a mere few of them.

\texttt{Include a description of the hardware used, such as the GPU or CPU the experiments were run on. 
For each model, include a measure of the average runtime (e.g. average time to predict labels for a given validation set with a particular batch size).
For each experiment, include the total computational requirements (e.g. the total GPU hours spent).}\\
\texttt{Note: You'll likely have to record this as you run your experiments, so it's better to think about it ahead of time.}

\hypertarget{sec4}{\section{Results}}
\texttt{Start with a high-level overview of your results. Do your results support the main claims of the original paper? Keep this section as factual and precise as possible, and reserve your judgment and discussion points for the next "Discussion" section.}


\subsection{Results reproducing original paper}
\texttt{For each experiment, say 1) which claim in Section~\ref{sec:claims} it supports, and 2) if it successfully reproduced the associated experiment in the original paper.}
\texttt{For example, an experiment training and evaluating a model on a dataset may support a claim that that model outperforms some baseline.}
\texttt{Logically group related results into subsections.}

\subsubsection{Result 1}
\subsubsection{Result 2}

\subsection{Results beyond original paper}
\texttt{Often papers don't include enough information to fully specify their experiments, so some additional experimentation may be necessary. For example, it might be the case that batch size was not specified, and so different batch sizes need to be evaluated to reproduce the original results. Include the results of any additional experiments here. Note: this won't be necessary for all reproductions.}
 
\subsubsection{Additional Result 1}
\subsubsection{Additional Result 2}

\section{Discussion}

\texttt{Give your judgment on if your experimental results support the claims of the paper. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your approach - perhaps you didn't have time to run all the experiments, or perhaps you did additional experiments that further strengthened the claims in the paper.}

\subsection{What was easy}
\texttt{Give your judgment of what was easy to reproduce. Perhaps the author's code is clearly written and easy to run, so it was easy to verify the majority of original claims. Or, the explanation in the paper was really easy to follow and put into code.}

\texttt{Be careful not to give sweeping generalizations. Something that is easy for you might be difficult for others. Put what was easy in context and explain why it was easy (e.g. code had extensive API documentation and a lot of examples that matched experiments in papers).}

\subsection{What was difficult}
\texttt{List part of the reproduction study that took more time than you anticipated or you felt was difficult.}

\texttt{Be careful to put your discussion in context. For example, don't say "The maths was difficult to follow", say "The math requires advanced knowledge of calculus to follow".}

\subsection{Communication with original authors}
\texttt{Document the extent of (or lack of) communication with the original authors. To make sure the reproducibility report is a fair assessment of the original research we recommend getting in touch with the original authors. We advise you to contact them through their email displayed in the paper and by asking specific questions.}

\section{Conclusion}
\texttt{Try to summarize the achievements of your project and its limits, suggesting (when appropriate) possible extensions and future works.}

\section*{Member contributions}
\texttt{Include a section specifying how you organized the work within the group and clearly describe the contributions of each member. Make sure to properly balance the workload among the members.}
